# Pair Programming
    
    - An Extreme Programming (XP) practice in which
        2 developes participate in one development effort at one workstation.
    - One, the "DRIVER" writes the code while the other "NAVIGATOR" or "OBSERVER", reviews the code
        as it is typed in. The 2 engineers switch roles frequently.
    - While reviewing the code observor also considers the strategic direction of the work, coming 
        up with the ideas for improvement and likely future problems to address. THis is intended to
        free the driver to focus all of their pay attention on the tactical aspects of completing current
        task using the observer as a safety net and guide.
