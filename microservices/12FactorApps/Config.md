# Config

Store config in the environment

Config or Configuration in the 12 Factor app is anything that changes between deployment environment.

An appâ€™s config is everything that is likely to vary between deploys (staging, production, developer environments, etc).

This includes:

  - Resource handles to the database, Memcached, and other backing services
  - Credentials to external services such as Amazon S3 or Twitter
  - Per-deploy values such as the canonical hostname for the deploy
  - Apps sometimes store config as constants in the code. This is a violation of twelve-factor, 
    which requires strict separation of config from code. Config varies substantially across deploys, code does not.
    
 Configurations should be strictly separated from your code.
 
 Configuration belongs to the ENVIRONMENT and NOT in the APPLICATION.
 
 Example:
        
        
        spring:
          application:
            name: myApp
          datasource:
            url: ${JDBC_DATABASE_URL}
        server:
          port: ${PORT:8080}
