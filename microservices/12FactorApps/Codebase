# 1. Codebase

One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

We should always make use of code repo.  A copy of the revision tracking database is known as a code repository, 
often shortened to code repo or just repo.
A twelve-factor app is always tracked in a version control system, such as Git, Mercurial, or Subversion. 

There is always a one-to-one correlation between the codebase and the app
