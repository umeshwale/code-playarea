Qualities of a Highly Effective Architect

    - What comes to mind when you hear the word Architect
        
 
Please read article ["Who needs an architect"](http://files.catwell.info/misc/mirror/2003-martin-fowler-who-needs-an-architect.pdf) - Martin Fowler
 
Be a mentor, not a tormentor
 
    - Nurturing is your professional responsibility
    - we need to help people with our learning and experience 
    
Knowledge is a wealth that grows when given 

    - When we explain someone then we learn new thing everytime
    
Criticize ideas, not people

    - start using WE instead of I 
    
Architecting is evaluating tradeoffs

    - It might have worked before but does this fits here to this scenario?
    - worst way is bringing emotions .. want to use Java because I like java
    - Dont decide because you know something .. use java because I know java
    - We should discuss and debate on both areas positive & negative dont be biased
    
Guide, dont dictate

    - give opportunity to people to figure it out
    "Two sets of people scare me: those who cant follow instructions and 
        those who can only follow instructions"

Practice collective ownership

    - Dont say it is my code or allow everyone to touch your code.
    - If someone saya I write readable code ask them who read it :) .. I know of only one 
        way to write readable code - ask a colleague to read it.

Allow Developers to figure it out

    - when we give opportunity to discover then they will be more convinved
    - It should be safe to be honest
    
Time box efforts 

    - Ask persons how much time you need to figure out 
    - Time box in hours and not in days 
    - Focus on outcome, not process
    
Prototypes beat any arguments

Gain domain expertise

Make software Extensible

Three Kind of peoples 
    
    - Those who know:
        1. Software but not domain
        2. domain but not software
        3. both software & domain
        4. Ignore fourth group :) 
            
Learn to Unlearn

    - what do i unlearn recently 
    - we all focused towards learning and not unlearning 
    - unlearning is a deliberate activity
    
Diversify your knowledge portfolio 

    - Dont get comfortable with one area only, your enemy is your comfort
    - always challenge yourself by moving out of comfort zone 
    - learn, be curious 
    - new things makes you happy and excited

Lead by example 

    - CODE EVERYDAY
    - if you are not coding then you are not leading by example
    - Architectural committe is where innovation goes to die.
    
A good architect practices what they preach

WRITE CODE
