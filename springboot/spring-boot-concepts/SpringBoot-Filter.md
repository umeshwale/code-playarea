# Spring Boot - FIlter

    A filter is an object used to intercept the HTTP requests and responses of your application. 
    By using filter, we can perform two operations at two instances âˆ’
    
        1. Before sending the request to the controller
        2. Before sending a response to the client.
        
The following code shows the sample code for a Servlet Filter implementation class with @Component annotation.
        
    @Component
    public class SimpleFilter implements Filter {
        @Override
        public void doFilter(ServletRequest servletRequest,
                             ServletResponse servletResponse, FilterChain filterChain)
                throws IOException, ServletException {
    
            System.out.println("In the filter");
            filterChain.doFilter(servletRequest, servletResponse);
    
        }
    }
        
Below is a snippet logs where we can see sysout from filter is coming first than controller-
