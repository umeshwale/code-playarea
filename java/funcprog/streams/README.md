This space is created to demonstrate Stream Features    

Streams:

       Stream is a new abstract layer introduced in Java 8.
       Using stream, you can process data in a declarative way similar to SQL statements.
       Stream represents a sequence of objects from a source, which supports aggregate operations.
       
       
Generating Streams: 

    With Java 8, Collection interface has two methods to generate a Stream.
        stream() : Returns a sequential stream considering collection as its source
        parallelStream() : Returns a parallel Stream considering collection as its source.
