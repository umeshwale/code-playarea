        long count() returns the count of elements in the stream. This is a special case of a reduction
        (A reduction operation takes a sequence of input elements and combines them into a single summary result by
        repeated application of a combining operation).
        This is a terminal operation i.e, it may traverse the stream to produce a result or a side-effect.
        After the terminal operation is performed, the stream pipeline is considered consumed, and can no longer be used.
        Stream.count() really shines when we combine it with other Stream methods â€“ most often with filter():
